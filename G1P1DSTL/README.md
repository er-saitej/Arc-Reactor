# Data Structures and Algorithms - Java Collections framework or C++ Standard Template Library

> This framework provides defined objects of various data structures - also called as containers.\
> Containers are objects which can store collections of other objects.\
> Example: Array of integers, strings etc.\
> This container can be as simple as collection of integers like array of integers as well as they can also be as complex as collection of functions or other objects.\
> Accessing can be done using iterators.\
> Not every collections can be iterated using indices. Data Structures like trees, linked lists cannot be iterated through indices.\
> Iterators are objects which are similar to pointers.\

# Sequence Containers

> Data is stored linearly inside a sequence.\
> Arrays, Vectors, Deque (Doubly ended queues), Forward Lists, Lists.\
> Arrays are of fixed sizes and Vectors can grow as elements are inserted into it.\
> In doubly ended queue (Deque), elements can be inserted both from front and back.\
> Forward lists are singly linked lists and Lists are doubly linked lists.
